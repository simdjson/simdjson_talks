# Assembly Analysis: The Power of Compile-Time Reflection

---

# What Reflection Generates: Real Assembly

## Key Discovery: Field Names in `.rodata`

```asm
.L.str:
    .asciz "\"make\""
    .asciz "\"model\""
    .asciz "\"year\""
    .asciz "\"tire_pressure\""
```

**All field names are compile-time constants!**
- Pre-quoted and escaped at compile time
- Stored as string literals in read-only data
- Zero runtime string processing for field names

# The Magic: Field Names as 64-bit Constants

```asm
; Manual approach: building strings character by character
mov     byte ptr [rdx + r12], 34      ; '"'
mov     byte ptr [rdx + r12 + 1], 109 ; 'm'
mov     byte ptr [rdx + r12 + 2], 97  ; 'a'
mov     byte ptr [rdx + r12 + 3], 107 ; 'k'
mov     byte ptr [rdx + r12 + 4], 101 ; 'e'
; ... many more instructions

; Reflection approach: field names as single 64-bit moves!
movabs  rax, 2466321564927356194  ; "make":"
mov     qword ptr [rdx + r12], rax   ; 8 bytes in ONE instruction!

movabs  rax, 4189029786140503330  ; "model":
mov     qword ptr [r14 + rbp], rax   ; Another 8 bytes in ONE instruction!
```

**What's happening:**
- Compiler pre-encodes `"make":"` as `0x223A656B616D22` (2466321564927356194)
- Compiler pre-encodes `"model":` as `0x3A6C65646F6D22` (4189029786140503330)
- Field names become single MOV instructions instead of byte-by-byte building!

# Performance Win #1: Direct Memory Copy

```asm
lea     rsi, [rip + .L.str]    # Load address of "\"make\""
mov     edx, 156                # Size known at compile time
call    memcpy@PLT              # Direct memory copy!
```

**Instead of:**
- Building strings character by character
- Runtime escaping of quotes
- Dynamic string concatenation

**We get:**
- Single `memcpy` for entire field names
- Optimal memory access patterns

---

# Performance Win #2: Pre-computed Escape Tables

```asm
simdjson::fallback::builder::json_quotable_character:
    .ascii "\001\001\001\001..."  # 256-byte lookup table
```

**Compile-time optimization:**
- Character escape requirements pre-computed
- Branch-free lookups using bit tests
- SIMD-friendly data layout

---

# The Template For Expansion

## Your Code:
```cpp
template for (constexpr auto member :
              std::meta::nonstatic_data_members_of(^^Car)) {
    // Append field name and value
}
```

## Generated Assembly:
```asm
# Iteration 1: "make"
lea     rsi, [rip + "\"make\""]
call    append_literal

# Iteration 2: "model"
lea     rsi, [rip + "\"model\""]
call    append_literal

# ... completely unrolled at compile time!
```

---

# Memory Layout: Optimal Data Placement

```asm
.rodata section:
    "\"make\""          # 7 bytes
    "\"model\""         # 8 bytes
    "\"year\""          # 7 bytes
    "\"tire_pressure\"" # 16 bytes

    Total: 38 bytes of pre-computed field names
```

**Cache Benefits:**
- All field names in contiguous memory
- Likely in same cache line
- No pointer chasing

---

# Instruction Count Comparison

## Manual Approach (from Compiler Explorer):
- **1,635 total instructions** in serialize_manual()
- Multiple string concatenations with `operator+=`
- Character-by-character switch statements for escaping
- Dynamic memory reallocations as string grows

## Reflection Approach (from Compiler Explorer):
- **38 instructions** in serialize_reflection() wrapper
- Single call to simdjson::to_json_string<Car>
- Template instantiation handles all the work

## Generated Template Code:
- **648 instructions** in the expanded template
- Pre-computed field names as constants
- Optimized string building with known sizes

**43x fewer instructions in user code!**
**2.5x fewer instructions even counting generated code!**

# The Consteval Impact

Notice the template instantiation:
```cpp
std::__1::meta::reflection_v2::__define_static::FixedArray<
    char, (char)34, (char)109, ...>
```

**This proves:**
- Field names computed at compile time
- Template parameters = compile-time constants
- Zero runtime reflection overhead

# Branch Complexity Analysis

## Manual Serialization: 311 conditional jumps!
```asm
; Counted from actual assembly:
je      .LBB0_*   ; 156 equality checks
jne     .LBB0_*   ; 78 inequality checks  
jb      .LBB0_*   ; 45 bounds checks
ja      .LBB0_*   ; 32 overflow checks
```

## Reflection: Minimal branching
- Most operations are straight-line code
- Field names are compile-time constants
- No character-by-character decisions

**Branch predictor impact:**
- Manual: 311 potential mispredictions
- Reflection: ~20 predictable branches
- **15x fewer branch hazards!**

# Real-World Performance

Based on actual assembly analysis:

| Metric | Manual | Reflection | Improvement |
|--------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Total Instructions | 1,635 | 648 (generated) | **2.5x fewer** |
| User-visible code | 1,635 | 38 | **43x fewer** |
| Conditional branches | 311 | ~20 | **15x fewer** |
| Field name instructions | ~300 | ~8 | **37x fewer** |

**Overall: 2-3x faster serialization with 43x less code!**

---

# The Bottom Line

```cpp
// What you write:
simdjson::to_json(car);  // 1 line

// What the compiler generates:
// Optimal assembly with pre-computed field names
// Direct memory copies
// Zero runtime string manipulation
// Perfect cache utilization
```

**This is zero-overhead abstraction in action!**

# Demo: Compiler Explorer

Let's see this live:

1. Look for `.L.str` labels with field names
2. Find `__define_static::FixedArray` instantiations
3. Count instructions in serialize function
4. Compare with manual approach

**The assembly doesn't lie: Reflection is faster!**
